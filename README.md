# Web Benchmark
We provide optimal configurations for web servers and databases. We tested and tuned the web servers and databases for best performance by using resouces efficiently.

## The problems we found.

  * Low throughput but using high resouces(invalid configuration)
  * Low throughput and using Low resources(Bottom neck occured somewhere)

## What We need ?
  * High throughput and using resource efficiently.
  * horizontal scale. (more resources, the throughput increases linearly)
  * Low latency(No one waits for response more than 2 SECOND)

## The Solutions
  * Benchmark web servers and databases
  * Provide optimal configuations
  * The ways to tune your systems.
  
## Avialable Frameware we have.
  * Ubuntu 18.04 + Apache server + php + mysql
  * Ubuntu 18.04 + Nginx + php + mysql
  * Windows server 2016 + ISS + C# + MSSQL
